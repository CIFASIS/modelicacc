## ModelicaCC

ModelicaCC is a Modelica C Compiler implemented in C++, the main goal of this project is to provide an environment to develop and test novel algorithms involved in the different compilation stages of large scale Modelica models. The different stages of the compilation pipeline follows the usual order: 

  * Parsing
  * Flattening
  * Index Reduction
  * Sorting
  * Code Generation
  * Simulation Model

The input/output of each stage are valid Modelica models (except for the very last stage which produce C code). Each stage converts the Modelica model fed as input into a “simpler” equivalent one. As the compiler uses the [QSS Solver](https://github.com/CIFASIS/qss-solver) for the C code generation and simulation, the goal of the previous stages is to obtain a valid μ–Modelica model.

The following tools are generated:  

  * parser
  * antialias
  * flatter
  * causalize
  * mmo

## Basic Installation

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd` to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `autoconf` to generate the configuration scripts.
  
  2. Type `./configure` to run the configuration script.
  
  3. Type `make` to compile all the binaries. The different tools are located 
     in the bin folder. 

  4. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean`.
